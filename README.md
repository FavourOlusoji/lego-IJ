This coursework is adapted from the Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures Wikipedia page. Developed using the Tailwind CSS framework and Flowbite library, the project commenced with an indianajones.html file. I later switched to a new file, indianajones2.html, to overcome design challenges. The most significant hurdle was achieving the envisioned design, leading to the decision to start afresh. Despite the complexities, the experience was both enriching and tiring but ultimately served as an excellent learning curve.
